I have begun building website of tour company. The project is vast and therefore I managed only certain part, gradually I will continue and finalize it.
Tour company will have some internal sites, including:

1. The site for the selection of tours, including the list of tours and filters. There will be some types of tours: 1. wine tour, 2. extreme tour, 3. Hunting-fishing tour, 4. History tour, 5. Sea tour, 6. mountain tour, 7. tour for medical procedures, 8. Tbilisi tour, 9. Tour in nature reserves (protected areas).
   Each tours will have following points: photos (slider), tour description, distance from Tbilisi, price, list of additional services related to tours. For example: if the tour is determined for disabled persons, translator-guide for deaf and dumb persons, also specially equipped bus and nurse for the transportation of disabled persons.
2. The second site will be determined for renting flats/hotels to tourists: including photos of flats, prices, by noting area, number of rooms and contact information of owner.
3. Separate site will be also provided for additional service, including various necessary information: related to weather, car rental, emergency service, patrol police call service, call for nutrition, call for taxi and also other links TKT.ge.
4. In the list of sites I added the site of guides, where will be provided information about guides, namely photo, personality, experience and rating.
5. Site about company.

   What about software, I apply REACT.js, bootstrap 4, SCSS, MDBReact, NODEjs, NPM, Js file for the creation of database. Later I will add directly MONGOdb database.
